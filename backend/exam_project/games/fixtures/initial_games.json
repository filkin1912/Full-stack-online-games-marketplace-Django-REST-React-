It began as a real‑time strategy series where players controlled armies of Humans, Orcs, Undead, and Night Elves, each with its own lore, heroes, and playstyle. Over time, the world of Azeroth expanded into novels, cinematics, and—most famously—**World of Warcraft**, the massively multiplayer online game that became a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAt its core, Warcraft is about epic storytelling: alliances forged and broken, legendary characters rising and falling, and a world constantly reshaped by war, prophecy, and cosmic forces. Whether through strategy battles or open‑world adventures, the series blends high fantasy with memorable characters and a rich, evolving world.",
